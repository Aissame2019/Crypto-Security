# Cryptography Python Code Snippets

This repository contains Python code snippets for various cryptographic operations. Each code snippet serves a different purpose and can be used independently. Below, you'll find a brief description of each code snippet.

## Code Snippet 1: Hexadecimal to Base64 Conversion

This code snippet converts a hexadecimal string to a Base64 encoded string.

## Code Snippet 2: XOR Operation on Two Buffers

This code snippet performs an XOR operation on two hexadecimal buffers of the same length.

## Code Snippet 3: Scoring Text

This code snippet scores the given text based on character frequency and returns a score.

## Code Snippet 4: Single-Byte XOR Decryption

This code snippet decrypts a ciphertext that was encrypted with a single-byte XOR key. It finds the best key and the decrypted text.

## Code Snippet 5: Detect Single-Byte XOR in a File

This code snippet reads lines from a file, detects single-byte XOR encrypted lines, and prints the decrypted text. Make sure you have a file named `cipher-hex-string.txt` containing hexadecimal ciphertexts, one per line, in the repository.

## Code Snippet 6: Repeating Key XOR

This code snippet performs repeating key XOR encryption on a plaintext using a given key.

Feel free to use these code snippets in your projects, and don't forget to customize the input data as needed for your specific use cases.
